UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.



 UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet. Learn more at undp.org or follow at @UNDP



The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN’s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life, as envisaged by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are on the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, working with governments and people on their own solutions to global and national development challenges to help empower lives and build resilient nations. The United Nations Development Programme UNDP Indonesia Country Programme 2016-2020 developed in partnership with the Indonesian Government addresses the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals and support national efforts to advance the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.



The programme contributes directly to MoH National Action Plan 2015-2019, objective 1) increasing the health status of society and; 2)increasing the responsiveness and protection to society towards social and financial risks related to health and Outcome 2 of the UNDP country Programme for Indonesia (2016-2020), which are aligned with the Indonesian Government Health Sector’s Objectives, commitment to Universal Health Coverage, SDG3 Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages (target 3.8 in particular) and other Sustainable Development Goals. One of its efforts is to be involved in supporting the transformation of health technology in the Ministry of Health through Network Strengthening and the Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative (BGSi).



BGSi is a new initiative of the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH). The initiative will act as a multi-institutional ecosystem that aims to support collaborative biomedical and genomic activities in Indonesia by leveraging strengths in technology and infrastructure including biobanking, data management, high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.



The initiative aims to build a national asset established under the Indonesia Ministry of Health with two major focusses. First, to establish a national biobank focussed on six conditions (diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, psoriasis, and rare/genetic diseases) which will store samples from participants where each sample will be connected to a registry that manages all information associated with the participant (demographic and clinical) and second, to generate Whole Genome Sequence information, for each of those participants, that will be curated in a national database. Samples and genomics information from healthy participants will also be collected and generated by this initiative. All samples and data will be made available to researchers nationally and internationally through BGSi.



The initiative will be organised around a headquarter facility located in Jakarta, housed in the MOH repository building and the historical Eijkman building, that will host the biobank and WGS labs respectively. BGSi HQ will manage the registry system and provide technical support for the Hubs and the entire ecosystem. A second and just as important part of the ecosystem is the hospitals (referred to as HUBs) where each HUB is in charge of managing activities related to recruitment, sample collection and tertiary analysis for the disease it has been assigned.



Therefore, UNDP needs 1 Software Associate who will be responsible to maintain, design, and/or development of systems tailored for existing and upcoming plans, specifically handling participant data (related to demographic, phenotypic, survey, biospecimen, and genomic data) within distinct software environments.



The direct supervisor of this activities is IT System Integration Architect Coordinator for BGSI. She/He will work closely with project team (BGSI, FMTA, and other projects in HEART related to Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative), operations units, and programme staff in the office to provide Technical Assistance and advice regarding biomedical and genome science-related issues and to ensure adequate exchange of information.

**Description**


Do you want to build a career that is truly worthwhile? The World Bank Group is one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries; a unique global partnership of five institutions dedicated to ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges. https://ww.worldbank.org.  

  

**East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) Region:**  

  

The EAP is a large and diverse region, ranging from Small Island States of the Pacific to the Philippines, China and Mongolia. Despite recording substantial economic growth and poverty reduction, the EAP region faces number of development challenges. Growth has been uneven across and within countries, institutions still need further strengthening, and most EAP countries are severely impacted by climate change. The Bank plays a significant role in helping countries generate global public goods, including increasing climate co-benefits; restoring and protecting biodiversity; reducing air, water and soil pollution; and improving health outcomes. EAP region views the Bank as a premier development institution with a leadership role in providing quality analytical and advisory services, as well as financing impactful and scalable projects and programs. https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/ea  

  

**Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy Global Practice (ENB GP) :**  

  

The Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy Global Practice (ENB GP) is located within the World Bank’s Sustainable Development Practice Group. We provide expertise, technical assistance and financing to help low- and middle-income countries manage land, sea and freshwater natural resources in a sustainable way to help create jobs, improve livelihoods, enhance ecosystem services, decrease pollution and increase resilience to climate change. Over 360 ENB staff working across the globe help set developing countries on a clean, green growth trajectory for resilient economies and healthy communities.  

ENB has five key business lines consisting of lending and non-lending services in (1) Forests, Landscapes and Biodiversity; (2) Blue Economy; (3) Pollution Management, Environmental Health and Circular Economy; (4) Environmental Economics, Policies and Institutions; and (5) Environmental Risk Management.  

  

**ENB has three broad and distinct functions:**  

  

* Provide clients with lending and non-lending services aimed to support the GP’s key business lines
* Support effective environmental risk management and sustainability by managing risk at the project level and creating opportunities to advance sustainable development, in part through the implementation of the World Bank’s environmental risk management policies; and
* Work closely with other sectors to mainstream environmental considerations into their policies, strategies, and operations.

  

On August 4, 2016, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved a new Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) to help protect people and the environment in the investment projects it finances. This effort is one of several key initiatives, including procurement reform, and the climate and gender strategies, recently undertaken by the Bank to improve development outcomes.  

  

The ESF responds to new and varied development demands and challenges that have arisen over time. It brings the World Bank’s environmental and social (E&S) protections into closer harmony with those of other development institutions, and makes important advances in areas such as transparency, non-discrimination, social inclusion, public participation, and accountability – including expanded roles for grievance redress mechanisms. The framework helps to ensure social inclusion, and explicitly references human rights in the overarching vision statement. The ESF is made up of the World Bank’s vision for sustainable development, the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy for Investment Project Financing, and ten Environmental and Social Standards (ESS). These set out the mandatory requirements for the World Bank, in relation to the projects it supports through Investment Project Financing (IPF), and for Borrowers.

Bank BTPN was established in 1958 to handle the pensions of retired military personnel. In February 2019, PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk (“BTPN”), an equity-method affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, merged with PT Bank Sumitomo Mitsui Indonesia (“SMBCI”), a local subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, to create PT Bank BTPN Tbk (“Bank BTPN”). Bank BTPN plays an important role in realizing SMBC Group’s Asia-centric strategy as a full-line commercial bank that offers a comprehensive range of banking services in both the wholesale and retail sectors.
  
  

Bank BTPN is now a universal bank which serves the mass market segment, the consuming class segment, as well as the corporate segment. On the mass market segment, we have BTPN Mitra Usaha Rakyat that focus on micro businesses, and BTPN Mitra Bisnis that focus on serving small and medium enterprises. For the consuming class segment, we have varieties of services including; BTPN Retail Lending Business that focus on serving retirees, BTPN Sinaya that focus on wealth management business, as well as digital banking service through BTPN Wow!, a financial inclusiveness service focusing on the unbanked segment, and Jenius, one of the pioneers of life finance and digital banking solutions in Indonesia. As for the corporate segment, we have the corporate banking business which focuses on serving national, multinational and Japanese companies.
  
  

The merger of BTPN and SMBCI to form Bank BTPN represents a unique and an ideal combination of two complementary banks. With its new vision to be Indonesia’s most preferred bank which makes a meaningful difference in the lives of millions powered by digital technology, Bank BTPN is a bigger and stronger bank that contributes more to Indonesia's economy. Bank BTPN believes that we will be able to unlock the opportunities that generate more valuable customer solutions across businesses.

Alta, previously known as Fundnel, is Southeast Asia’s largest digital marketplace for alternative investments. Alta gives investors unfettered access to invest and trade in a wide range of high-performing alternative assets, from direct investment into private companies, private equity and venture capital funds, real estate, luxury assets, and more. As a licensed integrated marketplace, Alta brings the trading and distribution of securities, fund management, payments solutions under one roof. Through its blockchain-powered exchange, Alta is also able to support the tokenization, digital custody, and trading of alternative assets. Today, while more investors are looking to increase their allocation to alternative assets, the high costs of investing and illiquidity of private markets can often give many investors pause. Alta makes it easier and more efficient than ever for investors to trade tokenized alternative assets at smaller, fractionalized blocks, thereby enhancing liquidity in the private markets, bringing alternative assets to all.

Since 2016, Alta has completed over US$600 million in transactions, creating access to over US$22 billion worth of mandated deals. Alta is backed by Nomura, Integra Partners, Binance Asia, Philip Securities and Prime Partners, and is headquartered in Singapore and operates offices globally.

At Alta, we are developing a suite of platforms and services that form the backbone of our operations. Brokerage: A rich and evolving web experience designed to cater to diverse investors, focusing on alternative assets across all classes through insightful, data-driven dashboards and deep asset analysis. Back-Office Operations Platform: A robust platform that integrates with numerous third-party service providers in KYC, payments, and settlement, along with ready integration with our internal systems to streamline operations across various departments. Exchange: A modern, digital-first asset exchange aimed at rapid API-driven trades, providing member firms with readily accessible market data through API integrations or direct UI access. Custody: An adaptable and scalable approach to digital asset tokenization, offering agnostic support across various asset classes and blockchains, coupled with a hybrid ledger for seamless custodial operations. As a Senior Engineer, you will play a crucial role in building and shaping these applications.

As a senior engineer, both hands-on development and technical leadership are big parts of the job. You’ll be a key technical stakeholder in our feature planning process, helping to map complex business requirements to technical solutions and offering your ideas and opinions. You’ll have extensive opportunities to mentor more junior members of the team, and will contribute significantly to ensuring we continue to hire the best engineering talent to the team.

* Expressing your ideas, opinions and feedback on our tech stack, tooling and culture to ensure we’re always improving as a technology team and as a company

**As our Senior Software Engineer, we know you’ll be doing significant learning on the job. That said, we’re hoping you’ll bring:**

* 5+ years of software engineering experience
* Strong experience in multiple object-oriented and/or functional programming languages. We’re language-agnostic in our hiring, but have JavaScript/Node, Rails, Python and others in our ecosystem stack
* A strong sense of what it takes to build a scalable, secure and cloud-native application architecture
* Able to choose the right coding pattern for the job, including around building easily testable code (if not via pure TDD, at least leveraging those principles)
* Good experience with source control systems like Github or Bitbucket, and how they work within a team
* Strong code review habits, leading by example on being proactive and constructive with comments and conversations among your peers
* Excellent knowledge data modeling in both relational and non-relational databases

* An appreciation for experimentation and designing systems/processes that accommodate business and technical agility
* Food! We talk about it a lot :)

As a close-knit, social team we generally prefer to work together in person at one of our offices. That said, we provide a flexible working environment that is adaptable to periods of working from home.
